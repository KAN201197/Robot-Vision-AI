# ME5411 Robot Vision & AI Project

This project has an objective to apply image processing technique which can improve image quality from original image showing some character on a microchip by reducing the noise and smoothing the image. It also use segmentation technique to extract the main feature on these objects such as converting to binary image, creating the outline of characters using edge detection method, and labelling each object which will be used later by machine learning algorithm for further analysis. The CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) used to create a classification system to analyze and classify each character on the original image and will be compared both of these apporaches in terms of effectiveness in classifying each character on the image.
